# crowd-map-2d
Let users create a world in 2D and see what happens

The objective of this project is to create a map editor / viewer and let users edit it (with a limit / user / day) and see what happens next.

Will the world be beautiful and harmonized ? Or total chaos ?

Why not making a game after this, but this is not the objective :)
